## Aviation Accident Data Analysis Project

### Project Overview

This aviation accident data project analyses and identify key trends, patterns, and factors contributing to accidents. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve aviation safety for stakeholders like airline operators, aircraft manufacturers, and safety regulatory agencies using Python and Jupyter.

#### Introduction
safety in aviation is a key concern globally.This Aviation Accident Data Analysis Project will help us understand the main factors that causes accidents.we will also be able to see the solutions that can help us mitigate the causes.

#### Problem Statement:
Despite all the mitigation measures put by the Aviation Safety Department accidents still continues to occur.this project will help us see the trends and also the measures that can be put.

#### Key questions:
--Are there specific weather seasons where accidents are high?

-What trends in accident occurrences can be observed from different phases of flight?

-what are the extent damage of aircrafts after accidents in some locations ?

-Which regions have the highest accident rates?
 
#### Stakeholder analysis

-The groups that will benefit from this findings are -Airline operators -Aircraft manufactures -Safety Regulations Agencies.Provide actionable insights to stakeholders (airlines, manufacturers, regulators) to improve aviation safety through our recommendations.

#### Objectives and goals

###### 1-Data exploration and cleaning
_Imported relevant libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

_Loaded the aviation accident dataset

_Checked dataset information and missing values

_Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns

_Filled missing values with "Not Available"

##### 2-Identify key trends and Weather.Condition patterns in aviation accidents to understand common causes.
-Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) are weather conditions under which pilots have sufficient visibility to fly aircraft relying on visual references.IMC (Instrument Meteorological Conditions) accounted for fewer accidents.Most of the Aircraft accidents occure during that weather conditions due to some factors like pilot errors -IMC,Not Availlable,UNK weather conditions were not high which could be caused from poor visibilities.

###### 3-trends in accident occurrences can be observed from different phases of flight.
.Landing phase had the highest percentage of accidents (17.36%)
.Takeoff and cruise phases followed with 14.05% and 11.55% respectively
.Strengthening runway safety measures to minimize maneuvering accidents.
    
###### 4-Evaluate high-risk regions to see if certain geographical areas have more accidents.
Anchorage, AK had the highest number of accidents (434),Miami, FL (200) and Albuquerque, NM (196) followed affected with cases of Aircraft accident due to volatile weather.other  locations have significantlyvlower accidents  counts but they need to be investigated to curb the factors.
  
###### 5-Identify how many aircrafts result in minor damage, substantial damage, or extensive damage in certain locations after the accident.
Substantial damage occurred in 72.17% of cases.Destroyed aircraft accounted for 20.95%.Minor damage was only 3.16%. Identify if certain aircraft models or makes are more prone to severe damage to mitigate the accidents
    
#### 6-Create Visualizations

5.Analyze the dataset.

#### 8-GitHub URL
git hub url:**git@github.com:Naomi-N-w/Phase-1-Project.git

#### 9- Recommendations
-Traininig pilots for extreme weather
-Require Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems for all commercial aircraft.
-Install lighted wind socks and night-vision-compatible lighting in remote areas.
-Encourage adoption of damage-tolerant Aircraft parts
-Use machine learning to flag high-risk flights based on maintenance/weather/pilot fatigue.

#### 10-Conclutions 
-Weather is a great Risk for accidents
-highest percentage of accidents occur during maneuvering.
-High-Risk Regions Need safety measures
-Damage Severity is Location-Dependent
-Data and Technology Are Game-Changers
